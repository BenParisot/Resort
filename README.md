# Resort Website

#### A simple website about a made-up sexy resort.

#### By Ben Parisot

## This website was created as part of the Practice: Branching and Merging project from Epicodus' Intro to Programming Evening Course, Week 2: GIT, HTML, & CSS.

I completed it at home as my pair and I didn't finish the section during class on Wednesday. I created a multi-page site and applied styles to it with a CSS stylesheet. I then created a new branch (style_2) and changed the styles. I then switched back to master branch, merged style_2 into master, and pushed master to my GitHub repo.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Open index.html in your web browser of choice
* Have fun exploring the site!
